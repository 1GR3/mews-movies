# About Mews

Weâ€™re developing a world beating Enterprise systems for the accommodation industry and have hotels live in over 19 different countries (as far as in Peru and Japan), and have over 150 installations - our biggest property has over 1000 beds. We are looking to scale up our operation to conquer Europe and then the US and Asia, and we are taking on some of the biggest names in the industry (chiefly Oracle) and beating them with a superior product.

We develop the Mews Platform, a suite of applications and a hub for interconecting hotels, guests and other vendors from the hospitality industry.
You can read more about our products at https://mewssystems.com/products.
If you want to know, why we have decided to build those products and what is our story, have a look at https://www.mewssystems.com/mewsfeed/2016/8/29/defying-the-odds-the-insanity-of-building-your-own-pms.

In short, we have the following products:
- Mews Commander - Property Management System, which is the main hotel system.
It stores all the reservations, helps managing housekeeping, enables to set prices in real time.
We are really good in handling hostels which are, in fact, very different from hotels.
Commander covers accounting, reporting, communication with channels (booking.com etc.), credit card payments, key cutting and many more.
- Mews Distributor - Booking engine widget. The hotel embeds Distributor on their website to convert the guest directly.
An example can be seen at http://emblemprague.com.
- Mews Navigator - Applications (web and iOS) for communication between the guest and the hotel. It offers the ability to check-in online.
When guest arrives to the hotel, they already have all the necessary information and it speeds up the on-site check-in.

## Mews Frontend

The latter two are SPAs. Distributor is done using our current React-based stack (este.js-like).
Navigator is waiting to be migrated from Angular.js (v1).

In case of Commander, the frontend is consisted of multiple SPAs and some inline JS code.
Our current frontend team is unifying it with our React stack as quickly as possible, but as many technolgies were used there in the past, it takes some time.

### Who we want to find?

Mews Systems needs more web developers who can improve our award-winning system. Candidates must have great knowledge of HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript and React. We're creating a World-beating application and need team members to move us forward:

We are looking for someone with web development experience with a strong understanding of HTML/CSS/JavaScript/React and responsive website development
Experience with modern frontend technologies and tooling (includes Flux (Redux), Relay, Webpack, etc.)
Experience with mobile applications development (especially React Native) or others are welcome.
Understanding of RESTful APIs
You must be able to communicate effectively in English
We are not micro-managers or hand-holders, but we expect you to find your own way from day one.
A good cultural fit is important as well: we are very motivated, but like people who like to deliver strong results and can work on their own.

We are looking for a person, who will join our frontend team and help them unify the current fronted stack and help us to make our vision happen.
Therefore, we need someone who has an experience with React.js and has analytical skills.
With a small team, we currently do not look for people, who are starting to learn how to code, we need you to be ready.
You would extend the core of the frontend team and once the team is large enough, you would be the one, who would teach juniors.
This is also, why the job cannot be remote.
We don't want you to become "an employee" - we want you to grow with us and eventually, if everything goes well, become a leader of your own product team and therefore stay with us for a while.


### What you can expect:

- Freedom to choose your own working hours as long as you deliver results.
- You will have the opportunity to spend time working out of our UK and NL offices
- Work with a super-motivated and highly experienced team of young professionals
- Guaranteed career growth potential
- Competitive compensation package
- Friendly and relaxed work culture
