### About Mews products

We develop the Mews Platform, a suite of applications and a hub for interconecting hotels, guests and other vendors from the hospitality industry.
You can read more about our products at https://mewssystems.com/products.
If you want to know, why we have decided to build those products and what is our story, have a look at https://www.mewssystems.com/mewsfeed/2016/8/29/defying-the-odds-the-insanity-of-building-your-own-pms.

In short, we have the following products:
- Mews Commander - Property Management System, which is the main hotel system.
It stores all the reservations, helps managing housekeeping, enables to set prices in real time.
We are really good in handling hostels which are, in fact, very different from hotels.
Commander covers accounting, reporting, communication with channels (booking.com etc.), credit card payments, key cutting and many more.
- Mews Distributor - Booking engine widget. The hotel embeds Distributor on their website to convert the guest directly.
An example can be seen at http://emblemprague.com.
- Mews Navigator - Applications (web and iOS) for communication between the guest and the hotel. It offers the ability to check-in online.
When guest arrives to the hotel, they already have all the necessary information and it speeds up the on-site check-in.

The latter two are SPAs. Distributor is done using our current React-based stack (este.js-like).
Navigator is waiting to be migrated from Angular.js (v1).

In case of Commander, the frontend is consisted of multiple SPAs and some inline JS code.
Our current frontend team is unifying it with our React stack as quickly as possible, but as many technolgies were used there in the past, it takes some time.


> Q: What did you use?
We have tried to use many different libraries and frameworks. Besides Angular.js, there are backbone, D3.js, jQuery (of course!).

> Q: What is your vision?
We like the way Slack does it (https://www.webexpo.cz/praha2015/prednaska/flexibility-and-rigidity-in-frontend-architecture/).
But our frontend team is currently really small, which means we have to use some of the existing libraries and frameworks to speed up our work.


Here are some of the key points of our frontend architecture:

### Who we want to find?

We are looking for a person, who will join our frontend team and help them unify the current fronted stack and help us to make our vision happen.
Therefore, we need someone who has an experience with React.js and has analytical skills.
With a small team, we do not look for people, who are willing to learn.
We need you to be ready.
You would extend the core of the frontend team and once the team is large enough, you would be the one, who would teach juniors how to do stuff.

We need you to take your job seriously, but be passionate about it.
If you want to work 9-5, not a minute longer, you probably wouldn't be a good match.
On the other hand, if you code as long as you are having fun and sometimes just forget to leave your desk, you are already one of us :-)
