# Backend development job

We are looking for someone with web development experience and a strong understanding of .NET and MVC. Candidates should also be able to communicate effectively in English. We are not micro-managers or hand-holders, so we expect you to find your own way from day one. A good cultural fit is important as well. We are all very motivated, but we like people who can deliver strong results while working independently.

Since we have a small team, we are not looking for people who are still learning how to code. We need candidates to be ready. We want to extend the core of the backend team so that once we have enough people, you would be teaching juniors. This is not a position for working remotely. We do not want you to become "an employee", rather we want you to grow with us and eventually become the leader of your own product team. If you meet these qualifications and plan to stay with us for a while, we think youâ€™d be a great fit.

## What can you expect?

- Freedom to choose your own working hours, as long as you deliver results
- Work with a super motivated and highly experienced team of young professionals
- Guaranteed career growth potential
- Competitive compensation package
- Friendly and relaxed work culture
